This ReplyTo plugin was written for Vanilla 2, circa early 2011.

So far as I am aware, it does not work on the latest versions of Vanilla.

If you have any fixes, pleas feel free to push them in this direction. I am
nto actively developing this plugin, but will be happy to accept fixes and
to advise on any changes that may be required.
